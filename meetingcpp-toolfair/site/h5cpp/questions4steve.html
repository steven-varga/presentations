### Topic to ask questions about

* H5CPP applications in real world
- financial market event processing: Ethernet/IP frames to HDF5
- moving image frames for Deep Learning
- modelling to production: Julia/Python/Matlab statistical/prototyping platforms to C++ binary
- IoT, sensor networks: robust fail safe and performant event recording with  SCTP protocol  to HDF5 
- ...your hard to solve problems....
* Compiler assisted introspection, and how you benefit from it: from arbitrary C struct to HDF5 without fuss...
* MPI-IO and HDF5: scalability from laptops to supercomputers: what to do when data is indeed big?
* H5CPP features and future: where is the development heading...
* Paradigm shifts: the relevance of easy data access in programming languages:
- Java had Java Persistence API solving heterogeneous type mapping to SQL
- Python has pickle to pickle away...
- can C++ have something similar, easy to use CRUD like data access? If so, why HDF5 format seems the best choice.
